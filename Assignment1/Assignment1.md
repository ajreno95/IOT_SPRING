## LED Control via Python

Write a Python script using one or more loops to produce the following effects, in order:

1. Turn off all LEDs
1. Delay 1 second
1. Over a period of 1 second, smoothly ramp the Red light from 0% to 100% intensity, and then back to 0% (i.e., half second ramp up, half second ramp down). 
1. Over a period of 1 second, smoothly ramp the Green light from 0% to 100% intensity, and then back to 0% (i.e., half second ramp up, half second ramp down). 
1. Over a period of 1 second, smoothly ramp the Blue light from 0% to 100% intensity, and then back to 0% (i.e., half second ramp up, half second ramp down). 
1. Over a period of 1 second, smoothly ramp White light from 0% to 100% intensity, and then back to 0% (i.e., half second ramp up, half second ramp down). 
1. Return to Step #1 (loop forever)

## GPIO Assignments

* The Blue light color channel is controlled by GPIO13
* The Red light color channel is controlled by GPIO19
* The Green light color channel is controlled by GPIO26
