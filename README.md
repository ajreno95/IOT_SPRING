## Course Description

This course provides students with a practical, hands-on introduction to connected devices and systems (aka Internet of Things).  Student pairs design and build a complete connected device system, gaining hands-on experience with device (embedded), cloud/web, and mobile software development and wireless communication technologies.  Students also develop experience with non-functional, systems topics including analytics, scaling and load testing, remote device update, and essential security.  The course has a heavy lab component.

The course will be a hands-on introduction to building Connected Devices (aka Internet of Things) products and services.  This will, by necessity, involve a wide variety of programming languages, systems, and technologies.  Given the time constraints, none of these can be explored in detail, but we hope to impart an overall systems understanding of how Connected Device systems can be architected and built, as well as introduce students to each major systems component and concept.

We will be exploring this space through a simple hardware product, whose functionality will evolve throughout the semester, as we integrate it with "the cloud" and mobile applications, as well as explore related topics, such as security and analytics.

We hope that by the end of the semester students will:

* have developed a systems level understanding of Connected Devices
* have enough understanding to dive deeper into the technology of any of the components
* have sufficient experience to prototype a product or concept idea of their own
